In earlier post you’ve seen that I am a great fan of neatly designed 404 pages. The way a 404 page tells you something about a company or a website is really cool and honest.

In my search for 404 pages I’ve found some websites with more then one 404 page. In this post I’ve listed some of the best ones I found so far.

Let me know what you think of them.

## 1. Marvel

Marvel had some budget left, so they made a bunch of 404 pages. At first I found one, the one were Iron Man looks at you, saying why the fuck you dare to enter his 404 page.
