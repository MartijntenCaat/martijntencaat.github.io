I’ve always been a fan of great web design. There is nothing better than neatly designed websites. One aspect of that design is a customized 404 page. I really, really like a 404 page that suits the purpose of the website or the brand having that website. It shows the level of playfulness a company or website builder has and is willing to show.

## 1. Lego

Starting at the tenth place, Lego has a nice 404 page. Find it at [https://www.lego.com/en-us/best404page](https://www.lego.com/en-us/best404page).
