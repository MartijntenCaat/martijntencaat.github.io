I’ve always been a fan of great web design. There is nothing better than neatly designed websites. One aspect of that design is a customized 404 page. I really, really like a 404 page that suits the purpose of the website or the brand having that website. It shows the level of playfulness a company or website builder has and is willing to show.

## 1. Lego

Starting at the tenth place, Lego has a nice 404 page. Find it at [https://www.lego.com/en-us/best404page](https://www.lego.com/en-us/best404page).

## 2. Jurassic World

Number 2 on this list, Jurassic World. This 404 page is a piece of art and shows some great detail. As if it just happened, the tension is tangible. The link isn’t working anymore, so this screenshot is all you get.

## 3. Star wars

Find it yourself at starwars.com/404. This page is in the ambiance of the movie I reckon, even tho I haven’t seen the movie yet.

## 4. Fandom

Check this 404 page out on fandom.com/404. Really nice twist to Pokemon and a very clean 404 page.

## 5. Netflix

Netflix shows a still of a movie, Lost in Space. Check it out on netflix.com/404. After seeing this I’m curious about this movie, prepare for movie night!

## 6. Pixar

At the website of Pixar you find a crying Sadness, which is very applicable in this case. Although it is just a 404 as the page itself states. Check it out yourself at pixar.com/404.

## 7. Distilled

This 404 page is most exciting because you can follow a conversation between two gentlemen. The conversation is about how you got there in the first place, but also about how to get away from that page, to get back on track again.

Extra kudos for the word “web-butler”, that’s a fancy name to call a developer.

Read their conversation at distillid.net/404.

## 9. Github
I’m not a fan of Star Wars per se, but this must be a reference to it, right? Check this nice 404 page out on github.com/404.

There’s a really nice background-position effect on this page. You can’t see it on this screenshot but you should definitely check it out.

## 10. Ready to go Survival

Test this one yourself at readytogosurvival.com/test-this-404. Giving the user a choice. Do you want to go to the homepage? Or do you prefer the getting prepared-page?

I like the way Morpheus looks at you.

## 11. Financial Times

Go to ft.com/404 to see for yourself. But in the meantime, have a scroll and see how the 404 page of the Financial Times looks like.
